This compute shader implements water deformation techniques inspired by SIGGRAPH 2022 – Rendering Water in Horizon Forbidden West.
By adapting the wavefront deformation approach introduced in the presentation, the shader is able to generate curling wave motion and produce a convincing breaking-wave (plunging breaker) effect in real time.

The system uses GPU-based displacement and curvature-driven deformation to simulate the characteristic rolling motion of large waves. This results in a dynamic and stylized wave shape suitable for real-time rendering, games, and NPR ocean effects.
